# boids-simulation Website

boids-simulation is a Boids Flocking Simulation built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It shows the concepts of boids and how they flock towards a target point on a 2-dimensional plane. 

Boids will flock towards the cursor position on the canvas.

Currently, boids are allowed to come into contact. In the future, force needs to be applied away from other boids if they come into close contact.
